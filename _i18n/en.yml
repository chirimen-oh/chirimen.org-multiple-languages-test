<p>The Web browser has had a significant role for human being in order to use computer network in modern society and the demand as computing platform to run various applications also increases.

<p>In the future societies as indicated by the concept of the Internet of Things (IoT) and Web of Things (WoT) where various physical things are connected through computer network, human existence remain important. Therefore, we need an environment where human and physical things cooperate with each other. We believe that such a future is going to be made centering the web browser.

<p>In this project, we aim to design and build the environment (platform) openly with the participants. We will be making suggestions on the identity of the Web as well as better relationship between human and physical things over the Web in the future society through discussion, making/trying out/improving prototypes.
